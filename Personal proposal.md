####Research Question:

    How does the news coverage of Spain differ between the United States
    and Great Britain?

    What are the Spain coverage trends of the two leading newspapers?

####Investigation Steps & Methods:

* Selecting keywords, crawling newspaper headlines of NYT and one of the leading British newspapers (The Telegraph, The Guardian, The Independent?). Time period – 3 months.
* Downloading the article data for further filtering .
* Creating data sets for a number of keywords and other conditional formations in reference to the coverage of Spain in these news outlets. (Keywords – “Spain”, “Spanish”)
* Organising data in tables, then using RStudio to filter data through a number of commands, discovering the days and the periods of the highest coverage of certain issues.

Some of the coverage issues to be researched:
* Who are the authors of the articles? Does the newspaper use foreign correspondent (how many articles)?
* What’s the categorization of the article? Does it belong to news/economic/tourism/other newspaper section?
* How long are the articles?
* Were the articles printed? On which page?
* Quotes – how often are quotes used and by whom?

→ Illustrating the data and putting it in context of the relevance of Spain to the different audiences of the newspapers addressed in this research.

#### The impact of investigation on answering the question:
- The investigation allows to go through the data from large archives of headlines in both newspapers to discover the mentions and articles from the Spain section.
- It allows to process this data and to create new data sets referring to the coverage of Spain over time.
- It allows to create conditional filtering and selection of data, leading to illustratable data.
